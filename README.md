## Hello, Hello!
###### (I don't know why you say "goodbye" i say hello, Hello Hello!)

### If you need to contact me, my discord is @BluNate
### Otherwise, welcome to my profile!

##### This is just a colllection of random stuff I felt like releasing, none of it's great in particular.
##### Generally what gets made and put here isn't my best work, or is just old.
##### There's a bunch of things i'll be working on at any given time, most of which never get released after completion.
##### You will see some serious projects, but those are usually just tribiutes to other silly projects by other people.
